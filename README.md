I developed a travel recommendation system that suggests tourist destinations based on user preferences and past visits. 
The system leverages cosine similarity to analyze destinations by type (beach, mountain, lake, etc.) and country, 
providing personalized recommendations. The project included building a robust user profile model, efficient destination 
filtering, and an algorithm for calculating the most relevant suggestions. The system was built using modern web 
technologies, with a focus on scalability, performance, and delivering a seamless user experience.
